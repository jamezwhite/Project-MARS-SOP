\chapter{General}

\section{Purpose}
\paragraph{}This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the operational procedures and operator selection/training requirements necessary to ensure safe flight operations for Project MARS by personnel within Keller Army Community Hospital (KACH). This SOP is designed to comply with all applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), and Army regulations, as well as KACH policies.

\section{Description of Operation}
\paragraph{}This SOP describes piloted and autonomous flight operations, maintenance and safety considerations, and personnel requirements related to the operation of multirotor sUAS within the Project MARS inventory.
\\
\\
\noindent \textbf{Note:} This SOP must be present in the operational area of use. A copy will also be maintained in the KACH Project MARS office.

\section{Applicability}
This SOP applies to all government and contractor personnel who are actively involved in air or ground operations related to Project MARS.  Operational procedures decribed in this SOP will be used to maintain prudent, safe operating practices and to ensure that appropriate response actions are taken in the event of an emergency.

\section{Proponent and Authority}
\paragraph{Proponent}The proponent for this SOP is the KACH Project Officer in Charge (OIC).
\\
\paragraph{Exception/Waiver Authority}The proponent may approve written exceptions/waivers to this SOP that are consistent with controlling law, regulation, and safety policy. The proponent may delegate approval authority in writing to the Project NCOIC when prudent for continuity.
\\
\paragraph{Limits to Proponent Authority}Any change that alters OPORD-controlled measures or authorities (for example, ACMs, altitude blocks, flight corridors/routes/boxes, TFB approval lanes, or delegated command authority) requires action by the USMA G-3 via FRAGO.
\\
\paragraph{Recommended Changes}Users submit recommended changes via email to the Project NCOIC or Project OIC; the Project OIC adjudicates and publishes approved updates.
\\
\paragraph{Precendence}In the event of a conflict between this SOP and controlling law, regulation, or policy, the controlling document takes precedence. The proponent will correct the SOP at the next revision.
