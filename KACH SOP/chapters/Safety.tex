    \subsection{Lost Communication (Lost Link)}
       
        \subsubsection{Situation} Lost Link refers to the loss of \ac{c2} between the \ac{gcs} and the \ac{suas} during flight. This includes primary and backup telemetry, command uplink, or video downlink loss beyond a pre-established threshold. Lost link may be temporary or permanent and can occur in both \ac{vlos} and \ac{bvlos} operations. All aircraft participating in Project \ac{mars} flights must be pre-programmed with an appropriate Lost Link procedure and contingency route.
    
        \subsubsection{Detection and Initial Assessment} Lost Link is detected when:
                
                \paragraph{} The \ac{gcs} indicates telemetry or control signal interruption (e.g., "No RC Signal," "Lost Telemetry").
               
                \paragraph{} The aircraft ceases to respond to manual inputs.
               
                \paragraph{} A pre-set timeout value (e.g., 3 seconds for control link, 10 seconds for telemetry) is exceeded without recovery.

            \subsubsection*{}The Operator shall immediately verify the condition by confirming: \setcounter{paragraph}{0}
            
                \paragraph{} Power and antenna integrity at the /ac{gcs}.
                
                \paragraph{} System status on secondary displays or via secondary control links (if available).
                
                \paragraph{} Possible sources of local interference or terrain obstruction.
    
            \subsubsection{Priorities}
        
                \paragraph{} Ensure safety of personnel, airspace users, and  infrastructure.
                
                \paragraph{} Prevent airspace incursion outside the authorized corridor.
                
                \paragraph{} Recover the aircraft safely to a pre-designated Rally Point or \ac{rth} location.
                
                \paragraph{} Maintain accountability of payloads (especially medical cargo).
                
                \paragraph{} Comply with \ac{faa}, \ac{dod}, and \ac{kach} safety policies.
            
            \subsubsection{Immediate Actions (All Flights)}
               
                \paragraph{} Attempt manual link recovery within 30 seconds.
               
                \paragraph{} If unsuccessful, monitor aircraft telemetry (if still available) and observe for programmed Lost Link behavior:
                    
                    \subparagraph{} Autonomous /ac{rth}
                    
                    \subparagraph{} Loiter-and-land
                    
                    \subparagraph{} Pre-programmed contingency route
               
                \paragraph{} Notify XXXXX.
             
                \paragraph{} If aircraft is non-responsive and on unsafe trajectory, initiate termination protocol.
       
                \paragraph{} Log time, location, telemetry status, and any deviation from planned route.
