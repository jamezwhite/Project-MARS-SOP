\section{Base-Level Operator Training}
Basic-Level Operator (BLO) level is the most basic pilot certification level, and consists of Basic UAS Qualification 1 and 2 (BUQ 1 and 2) certification completed via the SUASMAN website (or equivalent), plus 2 hours local training on the Project MARS airframe.  This level certifies the pilot to operate the KACH airframe in autonomous mode  only, under supervision of a higher-level Pilot Evaluator.  

Personnel trained to BLO Level are required to recertify with a currently qualified Pilot Evaluator annually.
